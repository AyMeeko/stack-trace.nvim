# TODO
Features for later:
- Python seems to use `class_definition` and `function_definition` but Ruby uses `method` and `class`??
    unclear if this will work for languages other than Python
    how: look at filetype and based on file type, set the "class" and "func" names accordingly
    also: maybe add a configuration option to turn off that feature
